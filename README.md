# clean-portfolio-spa-for-blogger
A simple portfolio template theme for use on the Blogger platform.

The feel of this site was inspired by the trend for single page web applications or SPAs which avoid page reloads when showing different categories of information.
Another driver for this project was the desire to have a working contact form after myself and some fellow developers were having issues with a particular hosting provider.
Blogger has had issues with their contact form in the past but at the time of writing it all seems to be working fine.
I have made this code available as an open source project.

- Licensing details to follow.
- Full instructions for uploading to Blogger to follow.
- This code is yet to be proof read by a fellow developer so I apologise for any typos etc.
